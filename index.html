    <h2 class="positioning">Our Mission</h2>
    <p class = "position"><br><br><br>Hello! Welcome to The ENNO Project website. 
        It is often said that natural talent can be overcome with passion and dedication. Whether it was for an instrument or sport, as long as a person is passionate and dedicated enough, oftentimes they will be able to overcome their obstacle. The ENNO Project stands for The Endless Notion Nonprofit Organization Project. At ENNO, our goal is to cultivate students’ interests or niches through learning. With our team, students will be able to choose what topic seems intriguing to them and learn more about it through guidance and hands-on experience. We, at ENNO, hope that with our guidance the students will be able to ignite a passion that’ll inspire them to have a chain of endless notions.  
        </p>
    <h2 class="positioning">Why ENNO?</h2>
    <p class = "position"><br><br><br>Our organization will focus on elevating kids' interest through learning. Studies have often shown that when kids are interested in something they are naturally more engaged in learning, leading to better focus and deeper understanding. Moreover, partnering with ENNO will not only help inspire the next generation of innovators, leaders, and professionals but also allow for other nonprofits to build strong, positive relationships with local communities, as well as strengthen their image. Ultimately, working with ENNO will benefit both the community and the partners, allowing for positive change. </p>
